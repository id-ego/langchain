# CTranslate2

**CTranslate2**는 Transformer 모델의 효율적인 추론을 위한 C++ 및 Python 라이브러리입니다.

이 프로젝트는 CPU 및 GPU에서 Transformer 모델의 성능을 가속화하고 메모리 사용량을 줄이기 위해 가중치 양자화, 레이어 융합, 배치 재정렬 등의 많은 성능 최적화 기술을 적용하는 맞춤형 런타임을 구현합니다.

기능 및 지원되는 모델의 전체 목록은 [프로젝트의 저장소](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/guides/transformers.html)에 포함되어 있습니다. 시작하려면 공식 [빠른 시작 가이드](https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quickstart.html)를 확인하세요.

사용하려면 `ctranslate2` Python 패키지가 설치되어 있어야 합니다.

```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  ctranslate2
```


CTranslate2와 함께 Hugging Face 모델을 사용하려면 먼저 `ct2-transformers-converter` 명령을 사용하여 CTranslate2 형식으로 변환해야 합니다. 이 명령은 사전 훈련된 모델 이름과 변환된 모델 디렉토리의 경로를 입력으로 받습니다.

```python
# conversation can take several minutes
!ct2-transformers-converter --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf --quantization bfloat16 --output_dir ./llama-2-7b-ct2 --force
```

```output
Loading checkpoint shards: 100%|██████████████████| 2/2 [00:01<00:00,  1.81it/s]

```

```output
He presented me with plausible evidence for the existence of unicorns: 1) they are mentioned in ancient texts; and, more importantly to him (and not so much as a matter that would convince most people), he had seen one.
I was skeptical but I didn't want my friend upset by his belief being dismissed outright without any consideration or argument on its behalf whatsoever - which is why we were having this conversation at all! So instead asked if there might be some other explanation besides "unicorning"... maybe it could have been an ostrich? Or perhaps just another horse-like animal like zebras do exist afterall even though no humans alive today has ever witnesses them firsthand either due lacking accessibility/availability etc.. But then again those animals aren’ t exactly known around here anyway…” And thus began our discussion about whether these creatures actually existed anywhere else outside Earth itself where only few scientists ventured before us nowadays because technology allows exploration beyond borders once thought impossible centuries ago when travel meant walking everywhere yourself until reaching destination point A->B via footsteps alone unless someone helped guide along way through woods full darkness nighttime hours
