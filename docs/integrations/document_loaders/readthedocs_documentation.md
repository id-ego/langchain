# ReadTheDocs Documentation

> [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) is an open-sourced free software documentation hosting platform. It generates documentation written with the `Sphinx` documentation generator.

This notebook covers how to load content from HTML that was generated as part of a `Read-The-Docs` build.

For an example of this in the wild, see [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/chat-langchain).

This assumes that the HTML has already been scraped into a folder. This can be done by uncommenting and running the following command

```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  beautifulsoup4
```

```python
#!wget -r -A.html -P rtdocs https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/
```

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ReadTheDocsLoader", "source": "langchain_community.document_loaders", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.readthedocs.ReadTheDocsLoader.html", "title": "ReadTheDocs Documentation"}]-->
from langchain_community.document_loaders import ReadTheDocsLoader
```

```python
loader = ReadTheDocsLoader("rtdocs", features="html.parser")
```

```python
docs = loader.load()
```
