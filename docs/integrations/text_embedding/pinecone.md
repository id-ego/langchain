# Pinecone Embeddings

Pinecone's inference API can be accessed via `PineconeEmbeddings`. Providing text embeddings via the Pinecone service. We start by installing prerequisite libraries:

```python
!pip install -qU "langchain-pinecone>=0.2.0" 
```

Next, we [sign up / log in to Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io) to get our API key:

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ["PINECONE_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("PINECONE_API_KEY") or getpass(
    "Enter your Pinecone API key: "
)
```

Check the document for available [models](https://docs.pinecone.io/models/overview). Now we initialize our embedding model like so:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "PineconeEmbeddings", "source": "langchain_pinecone", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain_pinecone.embeddings.PineconeEmbeddings.html", "title": "Pinecone Embeddings"}]-->
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeEmbeddings

embeddings = PineconeEmbeddings(model="multilingual-e5-large")
```

From here we can create embeddings either sync or async, let's start with sync! We embed a single text as a query embedding (ie what we search with in RAG) using `embed_query`:

```python
docs = [
    "Apple is a popular fruit known for its sweetness and crisp texture.",
    "The tech company Apple is known for its innovative products like the iPhone.",
    "Many people enjoy eating apples as a healthy snack.",
    "Apple Inc. has revolutionized the tech industry with its sleek designs and user-friendly interfaces.",
    "An apple a day keeps the doctor away, as the saying goes.",
]
```

```python
doc_embeds = embeddings.embed_documents(docs)
doc_embeds
```

```python
query = "Tell me about the tech company known as Apple"
query_embed = embeddings.embed_query(query)
query_embed
```
