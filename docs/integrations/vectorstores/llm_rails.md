# LLMRails

> [LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/)는 GenAI 애플리케이션을 구축하기 위한 API 플랫폼입니다. LLMRails에서 관리하며 성능과 정확성을 최적화한 문서 인덱싱 및 쿼리를 위한 사용하기 쉬운 API를 제공합니다. API 사용 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 [LLMRails API 문서](https://docs.llmrails.com/)를 참조하세요.

이 통합을 사용하려면 `pip install -qU langchain-community`로 `langchain-community`를 설치해야 합니다.

이 노트북은 `LLMRails`의 langchain 통합과 관련된 기능을 사용하는 방법을 보여줍니다. 이 범주의 다른 많은 통합과 달리 LLMRails는 검색 보강 생성에 대한 종단 간 관리 서비스를 제공하며, 여기에는 다음이 포함됩니다:
1. 문서 파일에서 텍스트를 추출하고 이를 문장으로 나누는 방법.
2. 자체 임베딩 모델과 벡터 저장소 - 각 텍스트 세그먼트는 벡터 임베딩으로 인코딩되어 LLMRails 내부 벡터 저장소에 저장됩니다.
3. 쿼리를 자동으로 임베딩으로 인코딩하고 가장 관련성이 높은 텍스트 세그먼트를 검색하는 쿼리 서비스( [하이브리드 검색](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search) 지원 포함)

이 모든 것은 이 LangChain 통합에서 지원됩니다.

# 설정

LangChain과 함께 LLMRails를 사용하려면 LLMRails 계정이 필요합니다. 시작하려면 다음 단계를 따르세요:
1. LLMRails 계정이 없는 경우 [가입](https://console.llmrails.com/signup)하세요.
2. 다음으로 API에 접근하기 위해 API 키를 생성해야 합니다. 코퍼스 보기에서 **"API Keys"** 탭을 클릭한 다음 **"Create API Key"** 버튼을 클릭합니다. 키에 이름을 지정하세요. "Create key"를 클릭하면 이제 활성 API 키가 생성됩니다. 이 키는 비밀로 유지하세요.

LangChain과 함께 LLMRails를 사용하려면 이 값을 가져야 합니다: api_key. 이 값을 LangChain에 두 가지 방법으로 제공할 수 있습니다:

1. 환경에 이 두 변수를 포함합니다: `LLM_RAILS_API_KEY`, `LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID`.

> 예를 들어, 다음과 같이 os.environ 및 getpass를 사용하여 이러한 변수를 설정할 수 있습니다:

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ["LLM_RAILS_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails API Key:")
os.environ["LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails Datastore Id:")
```


1. LLMRails 벡터 저장소 객체를 생성할 때 인수로 제공합니다:

```python
vectorstore = LLMRails(
    api_key=llm_rails_api_key,
    datastore_id=datastore_id
)
```


## 텍스트 추가

데이터 저장소에 텍스트를 추가하려면 먼저 [Datastores](https://console.llmrails.com/datastores) 페이지로 이동하여 하나를 생성해야 합니다. Create Datastore 버튼을 클릭하고 데이터 저장소의 이름과 임베딩 모델을 선택합니다. 그런 다음 새로 생성된 데이터 저장소 설정에서 데이터 저장소 ID를 가져옵니다.

```python
%pip install tika
```

## 유사성 검색

LLMRails를 사용하는 가장 간단한 시나리오는 유사성 검색을 수행하는 것입니다.

```python
query = "What do you plan to do about national security?"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search(query, k=5)
```


```python
print(found_docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
6  N A T I O N A L S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y Page 7 

This National Security Strategy lays out our plan to achieve a better future of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world.

Our strategy is rooted in our national interests: to protect the security of the American people; to expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and to realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life.

We can do none of this alone and we do not have to.

Most nations around the world define their interests in ways that are compatible with ours.

We will build the strongest and broadest possible coalition of nations that seek to cooperate with each other, while competing with those powers that offer a darker vision and thwarting their efforts to threaten our interests.

Our Enduring Role The need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater.

The world is becoming more divided and unstable.

Global increases in inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic began have made life more difficult for many.

The basic laws and principles governing relations among nations, including the United Nations Charter and the protection it affords all states from being invaded by their neighbors or having their borders redrawn by force, are under attack.

The risk of conflict between major powers is increasing.

Democracies and autocracies are engaged in a contest to show which system of governance can best deliver for their people and the world.

Competition to develop and deploy foundational technologies that will transform our security and economy is intensifying.

Global cooperation on shared interests has frayed, even as the need for that cooperation takes on existential importance.

The scale of these changes grows with each passing year, as do the risks of inaction.

Although the international environment has become more contested, the United States remains the world’s leading power.

## 점수가 있는 유사성 검색

때때로 검색을 수행하고 특정 결과가 얼마나 좋은지 알기 위해 관련성 점수를 얻고 싶을 수 있습니다.

```python
query = "What is your approach to national defense"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search_with_score(
    query,
    k=5,
)
```


```python
document, score = found_docs[0]
print(document.page_content)
print(f"\nScore: {score}")
```

```output
But we will do so as the last resort and only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our values and laws, alongside non-military tools, and the mission is undertaken with the informed consent of the American people.

Our approach to national defense is described in detail in the 2022 National Defense Strategy.

Our starting premise is that a powerful U.S. military helps advance and safeguard vital U.S. national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting the American people and their economic interests.

Amid intensifying competition, the military’s role is to maintain and gain warfighting advantages while limiting those of our competitors.

The military will act urgently to sustain and strengthen deterrence, with the PRC as its pacing challenge.

We will make disciplined choices regarding our national defense and focus our attention on the military’s primary responsibilities: to defend the homeland, and deter attacks and aggression against the United States, our allies and partners, while being prepared to fight and win the Nation’s wars should diplomacy and deterrence fail.

To do so, we will combine our strengths to achieve maximum effect in deterring acts of aggression—an approach we refer to as integrated deterrence (see text box on page 22).

We will operate our military using a campaigning mindset—sequencing logically linked military activities to advance strategy-aligned priorities.

And, we will build a resilient force and defense ecosystem to ensure we can perform these functions for decades to come.

We ended America’s longest war in Afghanistan, and with it an era of major military operations to remake other societies, even as we have maintained the capacity to address terrorist threats to the American people as they emerge.

A combat-credible military is the foundation of deterrence and America’s ability to prevail in conflict.
