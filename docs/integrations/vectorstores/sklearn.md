# scikit-learn

> [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is an open-source collection of machine learning algorithms, including some implementations of the [k nearest neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html). `SKLearnVectorStore` wraps this implementation and adds the possibility to persist the vector store in json, bson (binary json) or Apache Parquet format.

This notebook shows how to use the `SKLearnVectorStore` vector database.

You'll need to install `langchain-community` with `pip install -qU langchain-community` to use this integration

```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  scikit-learn

# # if you plan to use bson serialization, install also:
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  bson

# # if you plan to use parquet serialization, install also:
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  pandas pyarrow
```

To use OpenAI embeddings, you will need an OpenAI key. You can get one at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys or feel free to use any other embeddings.

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Enter your OpenAI key:")
```

## Basic usage

### Load a sample document corpus

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "TextLoader", "source": "langchain_community.document_loaders", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/document_loaders/langchain_community.document_loaders.text.TextLoader.html", "title": "scikit-learn"}, {"imported": "SKLearnVectorStore", "source": "langchain_community.vectorstores", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.sklearn.SKLearnVectorStore.html", "title": "scikit-learn"}, {"imported": "OpenAIEmbeddings", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain_openai.embeddings.base.OpenAIEmbeddings.html", "title": "scikit-learn"}, {"imported": "CharacterTextSplitter", "source": "langchain_text_splitters", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/character/langchain_text_splitters.character.CharacterTextSplitter.html", "title": "scikit-learn"}]-->
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_community.vectorstores import SKLearnVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

### Create the SKLearnVectorStore, index the document corpus and run a sample query

```python
import tempfile

persist_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "union.parquet")

vector_store = SKLearnVectorStore.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    persist_path=persist_path,  # persist_path and serializer are optional
    serializer="parquet",
)

query = "What did the president say about Ketanji Brown Jackson"
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```
```output
Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.
```
## Saving and loading a vector store

```python
vector_store.persist()
print("Vector store was persisted to", persist_path)
```
```output
Vector store was persisted to /var/folders/6r/wc15p6m13nl_nl_n_xfqpc5c0000gp/T/union.parquet
```

```python
vector_store2 = SKLearnVectorStore(
    embedding=embeddings, persist_path=persist_path, serializer="parquet"
)
print("A new instance of vector store was loaded from", persist_path)
```
```output
A new instance of vector store was loaded from /var/folders/6r/wc15p6m13nl_nl_n_xfqpc5c0000gp/T/union.parquet
```

```python
docs = vector_store2.similarity_search(query)
print(docs[0].page_content)
```
```output

## Clean-up

```python
os.remove(persist_path)
```
