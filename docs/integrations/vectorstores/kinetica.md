# Kinetica Vectorstore API

> [Kinetica](https://www.kinetica.com/)는 벡터 유사성 검색을 통합 지원하는 데이터베이스입니다.

지원하는 기능:
- 정확한 및 근사 최근접 이웃 검색
- L2 거리, 내적, 코사인 거리

이 노트북은 Kinetica 벡터 저장소(`Kinetica`)를 사용하는 방법을 보여줍니다.

Kinetica의 인스턴스가 필요하며, 이는 여기에서 제공된 지침을 사용하여 쉽게 설정할 수 있습니다 - [설치 지침](https://www.kinetica.com/developer-edition/).

Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. 

Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. 

One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. 

And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.

A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. 

And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. 

We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  

We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  

We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. 

We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.

It is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.  

As I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people. 

We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America. 

And we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice. 

We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities. 

4,000 projects have already been announced. 

And tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.

We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. 

I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. 

They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. 

Officer Mora was 27 years old. 

Officer Rivera was 22. 

Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. 

I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. 

I’ve worked on these issues a long time. 

I know what works: Investing in crime prevention and community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.

But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body. 

Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end. 

He didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she. 

Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better. 

Tonight, Danielle—we are. 

The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits. 

And tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers. 

I’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve. 

And fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it. 

This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you. 

Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.

## 벡터 저장소 작업하기

위에서는 처음부터 벡터 저장소를 만들었습니다. 그러나 종종 기존 벡터 저장소와 작업하고 싶습니다.
이를 위해 우리는 직접 초기화할 수 있습니다.

```python
store = Kinetica(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    config=connection,
    embedding_function=embeddings,
)
```


### 문서 추가
기존 벡터 저장소에 문서를 추가할 수 있습니다.

```python
store.add_documents([Document(page_content="foo")])
```


```output
['b94dc67c-ce7e-11ee-b8cb-b940b0e45762']
```


```python
docs_with_score = db.similarity_search_with_score("foo")
```


```python
docs_with_score[0]
```


```output
(Document(page_content='foo'), 0.0)
```


```python
docs_with_score[1]
```


```output
(Document(page_content='A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n\nWe can do both.

 0.6946534514427185)
```


### 벡터 저장소 덮어쓰기

기존 컬렉션이 있는 경우 `from_documents`를 사용하여 덮어쓰고 `pre_delete_collection` = True로 설정합니다.

```python
db = Kinetica.from_documents(
    documents=docs,
    embedding=embeddings,
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    config=connection,
    pre_delete_collection=True,
)
```


```python
docs_with_score = db.similarity_search_with_score("foo")
```


```python
docs_with_score[0]
```


```output
(Document(page_content='A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans. \n\nAnd if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system. \n\nWe can do both.

 0.6946534514427185)
```


### 검색기로서의 벡터 저장소 사용하기

```python
retriever = store.as_retriever()
```


```python
print(retriever)
```

```output
tags=['Kinetica', 'OpenAIEmbeddings'] vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.kinetica.Kinetica object at 0x7f1644375e20>
```
