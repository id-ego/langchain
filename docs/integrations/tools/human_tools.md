from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
math_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["human", "llm-math"],
    llm=math_llm,
)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

In the above code you can see the tool takes input directly from command line.
You can customize `prompt_func` and `input_func` according to your need (as shown below).


```python
agent_chain.run("What's my friend Eric's surname?")
# Answer with 'Zhu'
```
```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mI don't know Eric's surname, so I should ask a human for guidance.
Action: Human

Observation: [36;1m[1;3mZhu[0m

Final Answer: Eric's surname is Zhu.[0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```


```output
"Eric's surname is Zhu."
```


## Configuring the Input Function

By default, the `HumanInputRun` tool uses the python `input` function to get input from the user.
You can customize the input_func to be anything you'd like.
For instance, if you want to accept multi-line input, you could do the following:


```python
def get_input() -> str:
    print("Insert your text. Enter 'q' or press Ctrl-D (or Ctrl-Z on Windows) to end.")
    contents = []
    while True:
        try:
            line = input()
        except EOFError:
            break
        if line == "q":
            break
        contents.append(line)
    return "\n".join(contents)


# You can modify the tool when loading
tools = load_tools(["human", "ddg-search"], llm=math_llm, input_func=get_input)
```


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "HumanInputRun", "source": "langchain_community.tools", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_community.tools.human.tool.HumanInputRun.html", "title": "Human as a tool"}]-->
# Or you can directly instantiate the tool
from langchain_community.tools import HumanInputRun

tool = HumanInputRun(input_func=get_input)
```


```python
agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```


```python
