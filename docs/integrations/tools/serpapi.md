# SerpAPI

This notebook goes over how to use the SerpAPI component to search the web.

from langchain_community.utilities import SerpAPIWrapper
```


```python
search = SerpAPIWrapper()
```


```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")
```



```output
'Barack Hussein Obama II'
```


## Custom Parameters
You can also customize the SerpAPI wrapper with arbitrary parameters. For example, in the below example we will use `bing` instead of `google`.


```python
params = {
    "engine": "bing",
    "gl": "us",
    "hl": "en",
}
search = SerpAPIWrapper(params=params)
```


```python
search.run("Obama's first name?")
```



```output
