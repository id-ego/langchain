```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "InfinityEmbeddings", "source": "langchain_community.embeddings", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.infinity.InfinityEmbeddings.html", "title": "Infinity"}]-->
from langchain_community.embeddings import InfinityEmbeddings
```
