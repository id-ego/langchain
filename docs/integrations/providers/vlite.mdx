# vlite

This page covers how to use [vlite](https://github.com/sdan/vlite) within LangChain. vlite is a simple and fast vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.

## Installation and Setup

To install vlite, run the following command:

```bash
pip install vlite
```

For PDF OCR support, install the `vlite[ocr]` extra:

```bash
pip install vlite[ocr]
```

## VectorStore

vlite provides a wrapper around its vector database, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore for semantic search and example selection.

To import the vlite vectorstore:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "vlite", "source": "langchain_community.vectorstores", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.vlite.vlite.html", "title": "vlite"}]-->
from langchain_community.vectorstores import vlite
```

### Usage

For a more detailed walkthrough of the vlite wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/vlite).
