# DingoDB

This page covers how to use the DingoDB ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific DingoDB wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install the Python SDK with `pip install dingodb`

## VectorStore

There exists a wrapper around DingoDB indexes, allowing you to use it as a vectorstore,
whether for semantic search or example selection.

To import this vectorstore:
```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "Dingo", "source": "langchain_community.vectorstores", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain_community.vectorstores.dingo.Dingo.html", "title": "DingoDB"}]-->
from langchain_community.vectorstores import Dingo
```

For a more detailed walkthrough of the DingoDB wrapper, see [this notebook](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/dingo)
