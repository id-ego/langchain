# SQLite

> [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) is a database engine written in the
C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that
software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of
embedded databases. It is the most widely deployed database engine, as it is
used by several of the top web browsers, operating systems, mobile phones, and other embedded systems.
