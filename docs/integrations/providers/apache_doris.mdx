# Apache Doris

> [Apache Doris](https://doris.apache.org/) is a modern data warehouse for real-time analytics.
It delivers lightning-fast analytics on real-time data at scale.

> Usually `Apache Doris` is categorized into OLAP, and it has showed excellent performance
in [ClickBench â€” a Benchmark For Analytical DBMS](https://benchmark.clickhouse.com/).
Since it has a super-fast vectorized execution engine, it could also be used as a fast vectordb.

pip install pymysql
