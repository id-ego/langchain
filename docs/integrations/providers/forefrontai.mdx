# ForefrontAI

This page covers how to use the ForefrontAI ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific ForefrontAI wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Get an ForefrontAI api key and set it as an environment variable (`FOREFRONTAI_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an ForefrontAI LLM wrapper, which you can access with 
```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ForefrontAI", "source": "langchain_community.llms", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_community.llms.forefrontai.ForefrontAI.html", "title": "ForefrontAI"}]-->
from langchain_community.llms import ForefrontAI
```
