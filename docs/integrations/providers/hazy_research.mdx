# Hazy Research

This page covers how to use the Hazy Research ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Hazy Research wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- To use the `manifest`, install it with `pip install manifest-ml`

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an LLM wrapper around Hazy Research's `manifest` library. 
`manifest` is a python library which is itself a wrapper around many model providers, and adds in caching, history, and more.

To use this wrapper:
```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ManifestWrapper", "source": "langchain_community.llms.manifest", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/llms/langchain_community.llms.manifest.ManifestWrapper.html", "title": "Hazy Research"}]-->
from langchain_community.llms.manifest import ManifestWrapper
```
