# ModelScope

>[ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/home) is a big repository of the models and datasets.

This page covers how to use the modelscope ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific modelscope wrappers.

## Installation and Setup

Install the `modelscope` package.
 
```bash
pip install modelscope
```


## Text Embedding Models


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ModelScopeEmbeddings", "source": "langchain_community.embeddings", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.modelscope_hub.ModelScopeEmbeddings.html", "title": "ModelScope"}]-->
from langchain_community.embeddings import ModelScopeEmbeddings
```
