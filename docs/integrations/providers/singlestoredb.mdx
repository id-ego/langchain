# SingleStoreDB

>[SingleStoreDB](https://singlestore.com/) is a high-performance distributed SQL database that supports deployment both in the [cloud](https://www.singlestore.com/cloud/) and on-premises. It provides vector storage, and vector functions including [dot_product](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/dot_product.html) and [euclidean_distance](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/euclidean_distance.html), thereby supporting AI applications that require text similarity matching. 

## Installation and Setup

There are several ways to establish a [connection](https://singlestoredb-python.labs.singlestore.com/generated/singlestoredb.connect.html) to the database. You can either set up environment variables or pass named parameters to the `SingleStoreDB constructor`. 
Alternatively, you may provide these parameters to the `from_documents` and `from_texts` methods.

```bash
pip install singlestoredb
```

## Vector Store

See a [usage example](/docs/integrations/vectorstores/singlestoredb).

from langchain_community.vectorstores import SingleStoreDB
```

## Memory
