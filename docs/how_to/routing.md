# 서브 체인 간 라우팅 방법

:::info 전제 조건

이 가이드는 다음 개념에 대한 이해를 전제로 합니다:
- [LangChain 표현 언어 (LCEL)](/docs/concepts/#langchain-expression-language)
- [체인 실행 가능 항목 연결하기](/docs/how_to/sequence/)
- [런타임에서 체인 매개변수 구성하기](/docs/how_to/configure)
- [프롬프트 템플릿](/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates)
- [채팅 메시지](/docs/concepts/#message-types)

:::

라우팅을 통해 이전 단계의 출력이 다음 단계를 정의하는 비결정론적 체인을 생성할 수 있습니다. 라우팅은 상태를 정의하고 해당 상태와 관련된 정보를 모델 호출의 컨텍스트로 사용하여 모델과의 상호작용에 구조와 일관성을 제공하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.

라우팅을 수행하는 방법은 두 가지가 있습니다:

1. [`RunnableLambda`](/docs/how_to/functions)에서 조건부로 실행 가능 항목 반환하기 (권장)
2. `RunnableBranch` 사용하기 (구식)

우리는 첫 번째 단계에서 입력 질문을 `LangChain`, `Anthropic` 또는 `Other`로 분류한 다음 해당 프롬프트 체인으로 라우팅하는 두 단계 시퀀스를 사용하여 두 가지 방법을 설명할 것입니다.

## 예제 설정
먼저, 들어오는 질문을 `LangChain`, `Anthropic` 또는 `Other`로 식별하는 체인을 생성해 보겠습니다:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ChatAnthropic", "source": "langchain_anthropic", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain_anthropic.chat_models.ChatAnthropic.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}, {"imported": "StrOutputParser", "source": "langchain_core.output_parsers", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/output_parsers/langchain_core.output_parsers.string.StrOutputParser.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}, {"imported": "PromptTemplate", "source": "langchain_core.prompts", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.prompt.PromptTemplate.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}]-->
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

chain = (
    PromptTemplate.from_template(
        """Given the user question below, classify it as either being about `LangChain`, `Anthropic`, or `Other`.

Do not respond with more than one word.

<question>
{question}
</question>

Classification:"""
    )
    | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
    | StrOutputParser()
)

chain.invoke({"question": "how do I call Anthropic?"})
```


```output
'Anthropic'
```


이제 세 개의 서브 체인을 생성해 보겠습니다:

```python
langchain_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are an expert in langchain. \
Always answer questions starting with "As Harrison Chase told me". \
Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
anthropic_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """You are an expert in anthropic. \
Always answer questions starting with "As Dario Amodei told me". \
Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
general_chain = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Respond to the following question:

Question: {question}
Answer:"""
) | ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
```


## 사용자 정의 함수 사용하기 (권장)

다양한 출력 간에 라우팅하기 위해 사용자 정의 함수를 사용할 수도 있습니다. 다음은 예제입니다:

```python
def route(info):
    if "anthropic" in info["topic"].lower():
        return anthropic_chain
    elif "langchain" in info["topic"].lower():
        return langchain_chain
    else:
        return general_chain
```


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "RunnableLambda", "source": "langchain_core.runnables", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}]-->
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda

full_chain = {"topic": chain, "question": lambda x: x["question"]} | RunnableLambda(
    route
)
```


```python
full_chain.invoke({"question": "how do I use Anthropic?"})
```


```output

## RunnableBranch 사용하기

`RunnableBranch`는 입력에 따라 실행할 조건 및 실행 가능 항목 집합을 정의할 수 있는 특별한 유형의 실행 가능 항목입니다. 위에서 설명한 사용자 정의 함수로 달성할 수 없는 기능은 제공하지 않으므로 사용자 정의 함수를 사용하는 것을 권장합니다.

`RunnableBranch`는 (조건, 실행 가능 항목) 쌍의 목록과 기본 실행 가능 항목으로 초기화됩니다. 입력과 함께 호출될 때 각 조건에 입력을 전달하여 어떤 브랜치를 선택합니다. True로 평가되는 첫 번째 조건을 선택하고 해당 조건에 대한 실행 가능 항목을 입력으로 실행합니다.

제공된 조건이 일치하지 않으면 기본 실행 가능 항목을 실행합니다.

다음은 작동하는 모습의 예입니다:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "RunnableBranch", "source": "langchain_core.runnables", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.branch.RunnableBranch.html", "title": "How to route between sub-chains"}]-->
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableBranch

branch = RunnableBranch(
    (lambda x: "anthropic" in x["topic"].lower(), anthropic_chain),
    (lambda x: "langchain" in x["topic"].lower(), langchain_chain),
    general_chain,
)
full_chain = {"topic": chain, "question": lambda x: x["question"]} | branch
full_chain.invoke({"question": "how do I use Anthropic?"})

## 의미적 유사성에 의한 라우팅

특히 유용한 기술 중 하나는 임베딩을 사용하여 쿼리를 가장 관련성 높은 프롬프트로 라우팅하는 것입니다. 다음은 예제입니다.

```python
print(chain.invoke("What's a black hole"))
```

```output
Using PHYSICS
As a physics professor, I would be happy to provide a concise and easy-to-understand explanation of what a black hole is.

A black hole is an incredibly dense region of space-time where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This means that if you were to get too close to a black hole, you would be pulled in and crushed by the intense gravitational forces.

The formation of a black hole occurs when a massive star, much larger than our Sun, reaches the end of its life and collapses in on itself. This collapse causes the matter to become extremely dense, and the gravitational force becomes so strong that it creates a point of no return, known as the event horizon.

Beyond the event horizon, the laws of physics as we know them break down, and the intense gravitational forces create a singularity, which is a point of infinite density and curvature in space-time.

Black holes are fascinating and mysterious objects, and there is still much to be learned about their properties and behavior. If I were unsure about any specific details or aspects of black holes, I would readily admit that I do not have a complete understanding and would encourage further research and investigation.
```


```python
print(chain.invoke("What's a path integral"))
```

```output
Using MATH
A path integral is a powerful mathematical concept in physics, particularly in the field of quantum mechanics. It was developed by the renowned physicist Richard Feynman as an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics.

In a path integral, instead of considering a single, definite path that a particle might take from one point to another, as in classical mechanics, the particle is considered to take all possible paths simultaneously. Each path is assigned a complex-valued weight, and the total probability amplitude for the particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing (integrating) over all possible paths.

The key ideas behind the path integral formulation are:

1. Superposition principle: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in a superposition of multiple states or paths simultaneously.

2. Probability amplitude: The probability amplitude for a particle to go from one point to another is calculated by summing the complex-valued weights of all possible paths.

3. Weighting of paths: Each path is assigned a weight based on the action (the time integral of the Lagrangian) along that path. Paths with lower action have a greater weight.

4. Feynman's approach: Feynman developed the path integral formulation as an alternative to the traditional wave function approach in quantum mechanics, providing a more intuitive and conceptual understanding of quantum phenomena.

The path integral approach is particularly useful in quantum field theory, where it provides a powerful framework for calculating transition probabilities and understanding the behavior of quantum systems. It has also found applications in various areas of physics, such as condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and even in finance (the path integral approach to option pricing).

The mathematical construction of the path integral involves the use of advanced concepts from functional analysis and measure theory, making it a powerful and sophisticated tool in the physicist's arsenal.
