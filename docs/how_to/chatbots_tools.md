# How to add tools to chatbots

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chatbots](/docs/concepts/#messages)
- [Agents](/docs/tutorials/agents)
- [Chat history](/docs/concepts/#chat-history)

:::

This section will cover how to create conversational agents: chatbots that can interact with other systems and APIs using tools.

## Setup

For this guide, we'll be using a [tool calling agent](/docs/how_to/agent_executor) with a single tool for searching the web. The default will be powered by [Tavily](/docs/integrations/tools/tavily_search), but you can switch it out for any similar tool. The rest of this section will assume you're using Tavily.

You'll need to [sign up for an account](https://tavily.com/) on the Tavily website, and install the following packages:

```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community langchain-openai tavily-python

# Set env var OPENAI_API_KEY or load from a .env file:
import dotenv

dotenv.load_dotenv()
```

You will also need your OpenAI key set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` and your Tavily API key set as `TAVILY_API_KEY`.

## Creating an agent

Our end goal is to create an agent that can respond conversationally to user questions while looking up information as needed.

First, let's initialize Tavily and an OpenAI chat model capable of tool calling:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "TavilySearchResults", "source": "langchain_community.tools.tavily_search", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_community.tools.tavily_search.tool.TavilySearchResults.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}, {"imported": "ChatOpenAI", "source": "langchain_openai", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_models/langchain_openai.chat_models.base.ChatOpenAI.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}]-->
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

tools = [TavilySearchResults(max_results=1)]

# Choose the LLM that will drive the agent
# Only certain models support this
chat = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", temperature=0)
```

To make our agent conversational, we must also choose a prompt with a placeholder for our chat history. Here's an example:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ChatPromptTemplate", "source": "langchain_core.prompts", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.chat.ChatPromptTemplate.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}]-->
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

# Adapted from https://smith.langchain.com/hub/jacob/tool-calling-agent
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant. You may not need to use tools for every query - the user may just want to chat!",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
        ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
    ]
)
```

Great! Now let's assemble our agent:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "AgentExecutor", "source": "langchain.agents", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agents/langchain.agents.agent.AgentExecutor.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}, {"imported": "create_tool_calling_agent", "source": "langchain.agents", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agents/langchain.agents.tool_calling_agent.base.create_tool_calling_agent.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}]-->
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_tool_calling_agent

agent = create_tool_calling_agent(chat, tools, prompt)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

## Running the agent

Now that we've set up our agent, let's try interacting with it! It can handle both trivial queries that require no lookup:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "HumanMessage", "source": "langchain_core.messages", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/messages/langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}]-->
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

agent_executor.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="I'm Nemo!")]})
```
```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mHello Nemo! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?[0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```

```output
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="I'm Nemo!")],
 'output': "Hello Nemo! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?"}
```

Or, it can use of the passed search tool to get up to date information if needed:

```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            HumanMessage(
                content="What is the current conservation status of the Great Barrier Reef?"
            )
        ],
    }
)
```
```output

```

## Conversational responses

Because our prompt contains a placeholder for chat history messages, our agent can also take previous interactions into account and respond conversationally like a standard chatbot:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "AIMessage", "source": "langchain_core.messages", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/messages/langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}, {"imported": "HumanMessage", "source": "langchain_core.messages", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/messages/langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}]-->
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage

agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            HumanMessage(content="I'm Nemo!"),
            AIMessage(content="Hello Nemo! How can I assist you today?"),
            HumanMessage(content="What is my name?"),
        ],
    }
)
```
```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mYour name is Nemo![0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```

```output
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="I'm Nemo!"),
  AIMessage(content='Hello Nemo! How can I assist you today?'),
  HumanMessage(content='What is my name?')],
 'output': 'Your name is Nemo!'}
```

If preferred, you can also wrap the agent executor in a [`RunnableWithMessageHistory`](/docs/how_to/message_history/) class to internally manage history messages. Let's redeclare it this way:

```python
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(chat, tools, prompt)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

Then, because our agent executor has multiple outputs, we also have to set the `output_messages_key` property when initializing the wrapper:

```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ChatMessageHistory", "source": "langchain_community.chat_message_histories", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_history/langchain_core.chat_history.ChatMessageHistory.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}, {"imported": "RunnableWithMessageHistory", "source": "langchain_core.runnables.history", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.history.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html", "title": "How to add tools to chatbots"}]-->
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory

demo_ephemeral_chat_history_for_chain = ChatMessageHistory()

conversational_agent_executor = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    lambda session_id: demo_ephemeral_chat_history_for_chain,
    input_messages_key="messages",
    output_messages_key="output",
)

conversational_agent_executor.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage("I'm Nemo!")]},
    {"configurable": {"session_id": "unused"}},
)
```
```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mHi Nemo! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?[0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```

```output
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="I'm Nemo!")],
 'output': "Hi Nemo! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?"}
```

And then if we rerun our wrapped agent executor:

```python
conversational_agent_executor.invoke(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage("What is my name?")]},
    {"configurable": {"session_id": "unused"}},
)
```
```output


[1m> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...[0m
[32;1m[1;3mYour name is Nemo! How can I assist you today, Nemo?[0m

[1m> Finished chain.[0m
```

```output
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="I'm Nemo!"),
  AIMessage(content="Hi Nemo! It's great to meet you. How can I assist you today?"),
  HumanMessage(content='What is my name?')],
 'output': 'Your name is Nemo! How can I assist you today, Nemo?'}
```
