# Conversational RAG

:::info Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat history](/docs/concepts/#chat-history)
- [Chat models](/docs/concepts/#chat-models)
- [Embeddings](/docs/concepts/#embedding-models)
- [Vector stores](/docs/concepts/#vector-stores)
- [Retrieval-augmented generation](/docs/tutorials/rag/)
- [Tools](/docs/concepts/#tools)
- [Agents](/docs/concepts/#agents)

:::

In many Q&A applications we want to allow the user to have a back-and-forth conversation, meaning the application needs some sort of "memory" of past questions and answers, and some logic for incorporating those into its current thinking.

In this guide we focus on **adding logic for incorporating historical messages.** Further details on chat history management is [covered here](/docs/how_to/message_history).

We will cover two approaches:

1. Chains, in which we always execute a retrieval step;
2. Agents, in which we give an LLM discretion over whether and how to execute a retrieval step (or multiple steps).

For the external knowledge source, we will use the same [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng from the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).

## Setup

### Dependencies

We'll use OpenAI embeddings and a Chroma vector store in this walkthrough, but everything shown here works with any [Embeddings](/docs/concepts#embedding-models), and [VectorStore](/docs/concepts#vectorstores) or [Retriever](/docs/concepts#retrievers). 

We'll use the following packages:


```python
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-community langchainhub langchain-chroma bs4
```

We need to set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which can be done directly or loaded from a `.env` file like so:


```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

# import dotenv

# dotenv.load_dotenv()
```

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

Note that LangSmith is not needed, but it is helpful. If you do want to use LangSmith, after you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:


```python
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
if not os.environ.get("LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["LANGCHAIN_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Chains {#chains}

Let's first revisit the Q&A app we built over the [LLM Powered Autonomous Agents](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/) blog post by Lilian Weng in the [RAG tutorial](/docs/tutorials/rag).

# 1. Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog to create a retriever.
loader = WebBaseLoader(
    web_paths=("https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/",),
    bs_kwargs=dict(
        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(

        )
    ),
)
docs = loader.load()

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()


# 2. Incorporate the retriever into a question-answering chain.
system_prompt = (
    "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. "
    "Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer "
    "the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you "
    "don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the "
    "answer concise."
    "\n\n"

rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, question_answer_chain)
```


```python
response = rag_chain.invoke({"input": "What is Task Decomposition?"})
response["answer"]
```



```output
"Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable for an agent or model. This process helps in guiding the agent through the various subgoals required to achieve the overall task efficiently. Different techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts can be used to decompose tasks into step-by-step processes, enhancing performance and understanding of the model's thinking process."
```


Note that we have used the built-in chain constructors `create_stuff_documents_chain` and `create_retrieval_chain`, so that the basic ingredients to our solution are:

1. retriever;
2. prompt;
3. LLM.

This will simplify the process of incorporating chat history.

### Adding chat history

The chain we have built uses the input query directly to retrieve relevant context. But in a conversational setting, the user query might require conversational context to be understood. For example, consider this exchange:

> Human: "What is Task Decomposition?"
>
> AI: "Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable for an agent or model."
>
> Human: "What are common ways of doing it?"

In order to answer the second question, our system needs to understand that "it" refers to "Task Decomposition."

We'll need to update two things about our existing app:

1. **Prompt**: Update our prompt to support historical messages as an input.
2. **Contextualizing questions**: Add a sub-chain that takes the latest user question and reformulates it in the context of the chat history. This can be thought of simply as building a new "history aware" retriever. Whereas before we had:
   - `query` -> `retriever`  
     Now we will have:
   - `(query, conversation history)` -> `LLM` -> `rephrased query` -> `retriever`

#### Contextualizing the question

First we'll need to define a sub-chain that takes historical messages and the latest user question, and reformulates the question if it makes reference to any information in the historical information.

We'll use a prompt that includes a `MessagesPlaceholder` variable under the name "chat_history". This allows us to pass in a list of Messages to the prompt using the "chat_history" input key, and these messages will be inserted after the system message and before the human message containing the latest question.

Note that we leverage a helper function [create_history_aware_retriever](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.history_aware_retriever.create_history_aware_retriever.html) for this step, which manages the case where `chat_history` is empty, and otherwise applies `prompt | llm | StrOutputParser() | retriever` in sequence.

`create_history_aware_retriever` constructs a chain that accepts keys `input` and `chat_history` as input, and has the same output schema as a retriever.


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "create_history_aware_retriever", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.history_aware_retriever.create_history_aware_retriever.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}, {"imported": "MessagesPlaceholder", "source": "langchain_core.prompts", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/prompts/langchain_core.prompts.chat.MessagesPlaceholder.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}]-->
from langchain.chains import create_history_aware_retriever
from langchain_core.prompts import MessagesPlaceholder

contextualize_q_system_prompt = (
    "Given a chat history and the latest user question "
    "which might reference context in the chat history, "
    "formulate a standalone question which can be understood "
    "without the chat history. Do NOT answer the question, "
    "just reformulate it if needed and otherwise return it as is."
)

contextualize_q_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", contextualize_q_system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)
history_aware_retriever = create_history_aware_retriever(
    llm, retriever, contextualize_q_prompt
)
```

This chain prepends a rephrasing of the input query to our retriever, so that the retrieval incorporates the context of the conversation.

Now we can build our full QA chain. This is as simple as updating the retriever to be our new `history_aware_retriever`.

Again, we will use [create_stuff_documents_chain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html) to generate a `question_answer_chain`, with input keys `context`, `chat_history`, and `input`-- it accepts the retrieved context alongside the conversation history and query to generate an answer. A more detailed explaination is over [here](/docs/tutorials/rag/#built-in-chains)

We build our final `rag_chain` with [create_retrieval_chain](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html). This chain applies the `history_aware_retriever` and `question_answer_chain` in sequence, retaining intermediate outputs such as the retrieved context for convenience. It has input keys `input` and `chat_history`, and includes `input`, `chat_history`, `context`, and `answer` in its output.


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "create_retrieval_chain", "source": "langchain.chains", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.retrieval.create_retrieval_chain.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}, {"imported": "create_stuff_documents_chain", "source": "langchain.chains.combine_documents", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.combine_documents.stuff.create_stuff_documents_chain.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}]-->
from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain

qa_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system_prompt),
        MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
    ]
)


question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, qa_prompt)

rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(history_aware_retriever, question_answer_chain)
```

Let's try this. Below we ask a question and a follow-up question that requires contextualization to return a sensible response. Because our chain includes a `"chat_history"` input, the caller needs to manage the chat history. We can achieve this by appending input and output messages to a list:


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "AIMessage", "source": "langchain_core.messages", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/messages/langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}, {"imported": "HumanMessage", "source": "langchain_core.messages", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/messages/langchain_core.messages.human.HumanMessage.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}]-->
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, HumanMessage

chat_history = []

question = "What is Task Decomposition?"
ai_msg_1 = rag_chain.invoke({"input": question, "chat_history": chat_history})
chat_history.extend(
    [
        HumanMessage(content=question),
        AIMessage(content=ai_msg_1["answer"]),
    ]
)

second_question = "What are common ways of doing it?"
ai_msg_2 = rag_chain.invoke({"input": second_question, "chat_history": chat_history})

print(ai_msg_2["answer"])
```
```output
Task decomposition can be achieved through various methods such as using techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts to break down complex tasks into smaller steps. Common ways include prompting the model with simple instructions like "Steps for XYZ" or task-specific instructions like "Write a story outline." Human inputs can also be used to guide the task decomposition process effectively.
```

#### Stateful management of chat history

Here we've gone over how to add application logic for incorporating historical outputs, but we're still manually updating the chat history and inserting it into each input. In a real Q&A application we'll want some way of persisting chat history and some way of automatically inserting and updating it.

For this we can use:

- [BaseChatMessageHistory](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/langchain_api_reference.html#module-langchain.memory): Store chat history.
- [RunnableWithMessageHistory](/docs/how_to/message_history): Wrapper for an LCEL chain and a `BaseChatMessageHistory` that handles injecting chat history into inputs and updating it after each invocation.

For a detailed walkthrough of how to use these classes together to create a stateful conversational chain, head to the [How to add message history (memory)](/docs/how_to/message_history) LCEL page.

Below, we implement a simple example of the second option, in which chat histories are stored in a simple dict. LangChain manages memory integrations with [Redis](/docs/integrations/memory/redis_chat_message_history/) and other technologies to provide for more robust persistence.

Instances of `RunnableWithMessageHistory` manage the chat history for you. They accept a config with a key (`"session_id"` by default) that specifies what conversation history to fetch and prepend to the input, and append the output to the same conversation history. Below is an example:


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "ChatMessageHistory", "source": "langchain_community.chat_message_histories", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_history/langchain_core.chat_history.ChatMessageHistory.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}, {"imported": "BaseChatMessageHistory", "source": "langchain_core.chat_history", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chat_history/langchain_core.chat_history.BaseChatMessageHistory.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}, {"imported": "RunnableWithMessageHistory", "source": "langchain_core.runnables.history", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.history.RunnableWithMessageHistory.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}]-->
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.chat_history import BaseChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory

store = {}


def get_session_history(session_id: str) -> BaseChatMessageHistory:
    if session_id not in store:
        store[session_id] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_id]


conversational_rag_chain = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    rag_chain,
    get_session_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
    output_messages_key="answer",
)
```


```python
conversational_rag_chain.invoke(
    {"input": "What is Task Decomposition?"},
    config={
        "configurable": {"session_id": "abc123"}
    },  # constructs a key "abc123" in `store`.
)["answer"]
```



```output
'Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts help models decompose hard tasks into multiple manageable subtasks. This process allows agents to plan ahead and tackle intricate tasks effectively.'
```



```python
conversational_rag_chain.invoke(
    {"input": "What are common ways of doing it?"},
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "abc123"}},
)["answer"]
```



```output
'Task decomposition can be achieved through various methods such as using Language Model (LLM) with simple prompting, task-specific instructions tailored to the specific task at hand, or incorporating human inputs to break down the task into smaller components. These approaches help in guiding agents to think step by step and decompose complex tasks into more manageable subgoals.'
```


The conversation history can be inspected in the `store` dict:


```python
for message in store["abc123"].messages:
    if isinstance(message, AIMessage):
        prefix = "AI"
    else:
        prefix = "User"

    print(f"{prefix}: {message.content}\n")
```
```output
User: What is Task Decomposition?

AI: Task decomposition involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller and simpler steps to make them more manageable. Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts help models decompose hard tasks into multiple manageable subtasks. This process allows agents to plan ahead and tackle intricate tasks effectively.

User: What are common ways of doing it?

AI: Task decomposition can be achieved through various methods such as using Language Model (LLM) with simple prompting, task-specific instructions tailored to the specific task at hand, or incorporating human inputs to break down the task into smaller components. These approaches help in guiding agents to think step by step and decompose complex tasks into more manageable subgoals.

```


## Agents {#agents}

Agents leverage the reasoning capabilities of LLMs to make decisions during execution. Using agents allow you to offload some discretion over the retrieval process. Although their behavior is less predictable than chains, they offer some advantages in this context:

- Agents generate the input to the retriever directly, without necessarily needing us to explicitly build in contextualization, as we did above;
- Agents can execute multiple retrieval steps in service of a query, or refrain from executing a retrieval step altogether (e.g., in response to a generic greeting from a user).

### Retrieval tool

Agents can access "tools" and manage their execution. In this case, we will convert our retriever into a LangChain tool to be wielded by the agent:


```python
<!--IMPORTS:[{"imported": "create_retriever_tool", "source": "langchain.tools.retriever", "docs": "https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_core.tools.retriever.create_retriever_tool.html", "title": "Conversational RAG"}]-->

### Agent constructor

Now that we have defined the tools and the LLM, we can create the agent. We will be using [LangGraph](/docs/concepts/#langgraph) to construct the agent. 
Currently we are using a high level interface to construct the agent, but the nice thing about LangGraph is that this high-level interface is backed by a low-level, highly controllable API in case you want to modify the agent logic.


```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools)
```

We can now try it out. Note that so far it is not stateful (we still need to add in memory)


```python
query = "What is Task Decomposition?"

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]},
):
    print(s)
    print("----")
```
```output
Error in LangChainTracer.on_tool_end callback: TracerException("Found chain run at ID 1a50f4da-34a7-44af-8cbb-c67c90c9619e, but expected {'tool'} run.")

LangGraph comes with built in persistence, so we don't need to use ChatMessageHistory! Rather, we can pass in a checkpointer to our LangGraph agent directly


```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

agent_executor = create_react_agent(llm, tools, checkpointer=memory)
```

This is all we need to construct a conversational RAG agent.

Let's observe its behavior. Note that if we input a query that does not require a retrieval step, the agent does not execute one:


```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "abc123"}}

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Hi! I'm bob")]}, config=config
):
    print(s)
    print("----")
```
```output
{'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 11, 'prompt_tokens': 67, 'total_tokens': 78}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-022806f0-eb26-4c87-9132-ed2fcc6c21ea-0')]}}
----
```
Further, if we input a query that does require a retrieval step, the agent generates the input to the tool:


```python
query = "What is Task Decomposition?"

for s in agent_executor.stream(
    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]}, config=config
):
    print(s)
    print("----")
```

Above, instead of inserting our query verbatim into the tool, the agent stripped unnecessary words like "what" and "is".

This same principle allows the agent to use the context of the conversation when necessary:


```python
query = "What according to the blog post are common ways of doing it? redo the search"

    {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=query)]}, config=config

Note that the agent was able to infer that "it" in our query refers to "task decomposition", and generated a reasonable search query as a result-- in this case, "common ways of task decomposition".

## Next steps

We've covered the steps to build a basic conversational Q&A application:

- We used chains to build a predictable application that generates search queries for each user input;
- We used agents to build an application that "decides" when and how to generate search queries.

To explore different types of retrievers and retrieval strategies, visit the [retrievers](/docs/how_to/#retrievers) section of the how-to guides.
