title: Migrating from ConversationalRetrievalChain
---

The [`ConversationalRetrievalChain`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/chains/langchain.chains.conversational_retrieval.base.ConversationalRetrievalChain.html) was an all-in one way that combined retrieval-augmented generation with chat history, allowing you to "chat with" your documents.

Advantages of switching to the LCEL implementation are similar to the `RetrievalQA` section above:

- Clearer internals. The `ConversationalRetrievalChain` chain hides an entire question rephrasing step which dereferences the initial query against the chat history.
  - This means the class contains two sets of configurable prompts, LLMs, etc.
- More easily return source documents.
- Support for runnable methods like streaming and async operations.

Here are side-by-side implementations with custom prompts. We'll reuse the loaded documents and vector store from the previous section:


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet langchain-community langchain langchain-openai faiss-cpu
```


```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass()
```
